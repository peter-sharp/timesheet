# Timesheet Application Requirements

This document outlines the requirements for the Timesheet application, focusing on the migration of the archive section to Vanilla JavaScript signals and IndexedDB integration.

## 1. System Overview

The Timesheet application is a simple time tracking tool that allows users to record and analyze their work time. The application is undergoing a migration from a centralized state object to using Vanilla JavaScript signals and direct IndexedDB integration for the archive section.

## 2. Current Status

- Signals have been introduced for `archiveTasks`, `archiveEntries`, and `totalPages`
- IndexedDB adapter has been updated for pagination and search filtering
- `app-context.js` provides context signals
- `task-archive.js` has been partially integrated with signals and context

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Signal Integration

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Status |
|----|-------------|----------|--------|
| REQ-SI-01 | Replace state object references with context signals in timesheet-archive.js | High | Pending |
| REQ-SI-02 | Add effects to auto-trigger re-renders on signal changes in timesheet-archive.js | High | Pending |
| REQ-SI-03 | Use context signals instead of state object in archive-stats.js | High | Pending |
| REQ-SI-04 | Add effects to update charts and statistics reactively in archive-stats.js | Medium | Pending |

### 3.2 Event Handling

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Status |
|----|-------------|----------|--------|
| REQ-EH-01 | Update events to directly modify signals | High | Pending |
| REQ-EH-02 | Modify event listeners to call context update functions | High | Pending |

### 3.3 Data Storage

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Status |
|----|-------------|----------|--------|
| REQ-DS-01 | Verify store.js and indexedDBAdapter handle CRUD operations correctly | Critical | Pending |
| REQ-DS-02 | Ensure pagination/search parameters flow from signals | High | Pending |

### 3.4 Legacy Code Removal

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Status |
|----|-------------|----------|--------|
| REQ-LC-01 | Delete references to old state object in archive components | Medium | Pending |
| REQ-LC-02 | Remove legacy TODOs and unused code | Low | Pending |

### 3.5 Testing and Validation

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Status |
|----|-------------|----------|--------|
| REQ-TV-01 | Test pagination functionality | High | Pending |
| REQ-TV-02 | Test search filtering functionality | High | Pending |
| REQ-TV-03 | Test data loading from IndexedDB | High | Pending |
| REQ-TV-04 | Confirm signals drive UI updates without regressions | Critical | Pending |

### 3.6 Optimization

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Status |
|----|-------------|----------|--------|
| REQ-OP-01 | Remove migration console.log statements | Low | Pending |
| REQ-OP-02 | Optimize signal effects to prevent redundant renders | Medium | Pending |
| REQ-OP-03 | Ensure signal subscription cleanup in disconnectedCallback | High | Pending |

### 3.7 Documentation

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Status |
|----|-------------|----------|--------|
| REQ-DO-01 | Update documentation to reflect the new signal-based architecture | Medium | Pending |
| REQ-DO-02 | Document signal usage and IndexedDB integration for maintainability | Medium | Pending |

## 4. Testing Requirements

Tests should be run using the provided test runner to avoid CORS issues:

```
pnpm run serve-tests
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:3000/tests/index.html` to view and run the tests.

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

The migration will be considered complete when:

1. All archive components use signal-based state management
2. No references to the old state object remain in archive components
3. All CRUD operations function correctly with IndexedDB
4. UI updates reactively based on signal changes
5. All tests pass without regression
6. Documentation is updated to reflect the new architecture
