# TODO.md — File System Access API: Two-Way Sync with todo.txt / done.txt

## Recent Completions

### ✅ Fix Task Display Bug — Yesterday's Tasks Still Showing (2026-02-19)

Fixed two related issues causing tasks with `lastModified` from a prior day to appear in today's task list:

1. **Rollover not firing on tab focus**: The `_scheduleRolloverCheck` uses `requestIdleCallback` which doesn't fire while the computer is sleeping. When the user returns to a backgrounded tab after midnight, stale yesterday state remained. Fixed by adding a synchronous date check in the `visibilitychange` handler that immediately calls `_reloadTodayData()` if the date has changed.

2. **Stub tasks from entry data**: After rollover, if today's entries reference a task whose `lastModified` is from a prior day, `recalculateTaskTotals` would create a minimal stub (no description/client). Added `_ensureEntryTasksLoaded()` which loads full task data from the DB for any such tasks and updates their `lastModified` to today so they appear correctly on subsequent reloads.

**Tests:** 2 new regression tests added — all 14 tests pass.

### ✅ Task Status Dialog on Checkbox Long Press / Right Click (2026-02-18)

Added a status picker dialog to the task checkbox in `task-status.js`. Long pressing (500 ms) or right-clicking the checkbox opens a menu with four statuses:

- **Not started** — empty checkbox (default)
- **In progress** — blue box with play-triangle icon
- **On hold** — orange box with pause-bars icon
- **Complete** — green box with checkmark icon

The dialog dispatches a `taskStatusChange` custom event. `task-list.js` relays it as `taskStatusChanged` to `app-context.js`, which persists both the new `status` field and the derived `complete` boolean. A simple click still toggles between *not started* and *complete* (backward-compatible).

### ✅ Fix Rollover lastModified Still Being Updated (2026-02-18)

Deeper fix for rollover: `updateTask`/`updateEntry` with `preserveTimestamp: true` was preserving the in-memory `lastModified`, not the DB's stored timestamp. When `handleNewEntry` creates a task stub for a task that isn't in today's view (e.g. after rollover), the stub has `lastModified: new Date()`. The upsert then calls `updateTask(stub, { preserveTimestamp: true })` which kept today's date.

**Fix:** When `preserveTimestamp: true`, read the current DB record's `lastModified` instead of trusting the in-memory value.

**Tests:** New regression test added: "rollover: preserveTimestamp uses DB timestamp even when in-memory task has new Date()". All 12 tests pass.

### ✅ Fix Rollover Clearout (2026-02-17)

Fixed rollover clearout not working properly. Tasks modified yesterday were appearing in today's view because:
1. When adding entries for yesterday's tasks, the code created new task objects with today's timestamp instead of loading from database
2. Updating UI state (timingState) was incorrectly updating lastModified timestamps

**Solution:** Load tasks from database when they don't exist in today's state, and only update lastModified when actual task data changes (not transient UI state).

**Tests:** All rollover timestamp preservation tests pass.

## Context

The timesheet PWA manages tasks in IndexedDB but has no way to sync with external files. Users want to maintain a local `todo.txt` and `done.txt` (the [todo.txt standard](https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt)) so tasks are editable from any text editor. The File System Access API (`showOpenFilePicker`, `FileSystemFileHandle.createWritable`) works on GitHub Pages — it only needs HTTPS (no special COOP/COEP headers). Browser support is Chromium-only (Chrome, Edge).

**Sync behaviour:** Two-way, on every change — but **only when the app is idle**. Outbound writes are scheduled via `requestIdleCallback` (the same pattern used by `_scheduleRolloverCheck` in `app-context.js`) so they never block user interaction. Inbound reads happen on `visibilitychange` (tab refocus) and initial load.

**Format:** The app's existing `#exid description +project client:name` format is valid todo.txt (everything after optional priority/date is free-form description). Completed tasks get the standard `x YYYY-MM-DD` prefix and live in `done.txt`.

---

## UX Research: File Picker Placement

**Constraint:** Linking files is a one-time setup action. It must not compete with the primary actions (editing tasks and time entries).

**Decision: Reuse the `...` popup menu pattern from the Original branch.** The Original branch already has a `<details class="popup-menu"><summary>...</summary>` inside the footer nav with links to Archive, Settings, and Sync. We bring this pattern to main — but only with the file sync items (no Archive/Settings/Sync pages since those were removed in the Overhaul). The `...` trigger is minimal, familiar, and already has full CSS support via `.popup-menu`, `.popup-menu__body`.

The menu contains:
- "Link todo.txt" / file name + "Unlink" toggle
- "Link done.txt" / file name + "Unlink" toggle

This sits in the nav alongside Tasks, Timeline, and current-task — visually lightweight, doesn't compete with main actions.

## Files to Create

### 1. `todoTxtFormat.js` — Format conversion (pure functions)

- `taskToLine(task)` — converts task object → todo.txt line
  - Incomplete: `#exid description +project client:name`
  - Complete: `x 2026-02-08 #exid description +project client:name`
- `lineToTask(line)` — parses a line back into `{ exid, description, project, client, complete }`
  - Detects `x YYYY-MM-DD` prefix for completion
  - Reuses `extract()` from [utils/extract.js](utils/extract.js) for `#exid`, `+project`, `client:` parsing
- `tasksToTodoTxt(tasks)` — filters incomplete → maps `taskToLine` → joins with `\n`
- `tasksToDoneTxt(tasks)` — filters complete → maps `taskToLine` → joins with `\n`
- `parseTodoTxt(text)` — splits on `\n` → filters blanks → maps `lineToTask`

### 2. `fileSync.js` — File System Access API wrapper

- `pickFile(description)` — calls `showOpenFilePicker({ types: [{ description, accept: { 'text/plain': ['.txt'] } }] })`
- `readFile(handle)` — `handle.getFile()` then `.text()`
- `writeFile(handle, content)` — `handle.createWritable()` → `.write(content)` → `.close()`
- `verifyPermission(handle)` — `queryPermission({ mode: 'readwrite' })`, if not `'granted'` then `requestPermission()`
- `storeHandle(key, handle, fileName)` — persists to IndexedDB `fileHandles` store
- `retrieveHandle(key)` — loads from IndexedDB
- `removeHandle(key)` — deletes from IndexedDB
- Feature detection: check `window.showOpenFilePicker` exists

### 3. `syncEngine.js` — Two-way merge logic

- `syncOutbound(tasks, db)` — retrieves handles from DB, verifies permission, writes `tasksToTodoTxt` → todo.txt, `tasksToDoneTxt` → done.txt. **Scheduled via `requestIdleCallback`** so writes never block the UI. Coalesces rapid edits automatically (each idle callback cancels any pending previous one).
- `syncInbound(appTasks, db)` — reads both files, parses, merges with app tasks. Returns merged array or `null` if no files linked.
- `mergeTasks(appTasks, fileTasks)` — merge by `exid` key:
  - Task in file only → add to app (new from external editor)
  - Task in both → file wins for text fields (description, project, client, complete); app wins for time-tracking fields (total, mostRecentEntry, entries)
  - Task in app only → keep (not deleted just because absent from file — avoids accidental data loss)
- Handles permission denial gracefully (silent no-op, shows status in menu)

### 4. `file-sync-menu.js` — Custom element for the popup menu

- Renders inside the `...` popup menu (`.popup-menu__body`)
- On connect: queries IndexedDB for existing handles, shows linked file names
- Unlinked state: "Link todo.txt" / "Link done.txt" buttons
- Linked state: file name + "Unlink" button for each
- On "Link" click: calls `pickFile()`, stores handle, triggers initial sync
- On "Unlink" click: removes handle from IndexedDB
- If `showOpenFilePicker` is unavailable: shows "Not supported in this browser"
- If permission denied on re-visit: shows "Permission needed — click to re-grant"

### 5. `e2e/file-sync-format.spec.js` — Format conversion tests

### 6. `e2e/file-sync-merge.spec.js` — Merge logic tests

### 7. `e2e/file-sync-menu.spec.js` — Menu UI tests

## Files to Modify

### 8. [timesheetDb.js](timesheetDb.js) — Add fileHandles store

- Bump `version` from `5` to `6` (line 68)
- Add new `fileHandlesDb` module via `TimesheetDB.modules.push()`:
  - `upgrade()`: create `fileHandles` object store with `keyPath: 'key'` (only if not exists)
  - `init()`: expose `putFileHandle(key, handle, fileName)`, `getFileHandle(key)`, `deleteFileHandle(key)`
- `FileSystemFileHandle` is structured-clonable, so it stores directly in IndexedDB

### 9. [app-context.js](app-context.js) — Hook sync into state lifecycle

- Import `syncOutbound` and `syncInbound` from `syncEngine.js`
- In `persistState()` (line 500): after `store.write()`, schedule `syncOutbound(this.tasks.value)` via `requestIdleCallback` (cancel any previously pending idle callback to coalesce rapid changes)
- In `connectedCallback()` (line 115): add `visibilitychange` listener that schedules `syncInbound()` via `requestIdleCallback` when tab regains focus, merges result into `this.tasks`
- In `initialize()`: after loading state, schedule `syncInbound()` via `requestIdleCallback` for initial file read (app renders first, syncs when idle)

### 10. [index.html](index.html) — Add `...` popup menu to footer nav

Add a new `<li>` to the nav `<ul>` (after the Timeline link, before current-task), reusing the exact popup menu pattern from the Original branch:
```html
<li>
  <details class="popup-menu">
    <summary>...</summary>
    <div class="popup-menu__body">
      <file-sync-menu></file-sync-menu>
    </div>
  </details>
</li>
```
The app icon `<h1>` stays unchanged as a decorative element.

### 11. [script.js](script.js) — Import new component, bump version

- Add `import "./file-sync-menu.js";`
- Bump `APP_VERSION` from `"1.4.0"` to `"1.5.0"`

### 12. [serviceWorker.js](serviceWorker.js) — Cache new files

Add to assets array:
```
"./todoTxtFormat.js",
"./fileSync.js",
"./syncEngine.js",
"./file-sync-menu.js",
```

### 13. [style.css](style.css) — Menu component styles

```css
file-sync-menu {
  display: block;
  white-space: nowrap;
  font-size: 0.85rem;
}
file-sync-menu button {
  font-size: 0.85rem;
}
```

### 14. [e2e/helpers.js](e2e/helpers.js) — Test helpers

- Update `seedIndexedDB` to use DB version 6
- Add `seedFileHandle(page, key, fileName)` helper for menu UI tests

---

## Tests

### Format conversion (`e2e/file-sync-format.spec.js`)

Run in-browser via `page.evaluate()` importing `todoTxtFormat.js`:

- [ ] `taskToLine` — incomplete task with all fields
- [ ] `taskToLine` — incomplete task with missing optional fields (no project, no client)
- [ ] `taskToLine` — completed task includes `x YYYY-MM-DD` prefix
- [ ] `lineToTask` — parses line with `#exid`, `+project`, `client:name`
- [ ] `lineToTask` — parses line with only description (no tags)
- [ ] `lineToTask` — parses completed line (`x 2026-02-08 ...`)
- [ ] `tasksToTodoTxt` — filters out completed tasks, joins with newlines
- [ ] `tasksToDoneTxt` — filters out incomplete tasks, joins with newlines
- [ ] `parseTodoTxt` — handles empty lines and whitespace
- [ ] Round-trip: `lineToTask(taskToLine(task))` preserves all fields

### Merge logic (`e2e/file-sync-merge.spec.js`)

Run in-browser via `page.evaluate()` importing `syncEngine.js`:

- [ ] New task in file only → added to app
- [ ] Task in both, file has updated description → description updated in app
- [ ] Task in both, file marks complete → app task marked complete
- [ ] Task in app only (not in file) → preserved (no data loss)
- [ ] Completed task in done.txt → imported as complete
- [ ] Task moved from todo.txt to done.txt → app task updated to complete
- [ ] App time-tracking fields (total, mostRecentEntry) preserved after merge
- [ ] Empty file → no tasks added, existing app tasks preserved

### Menu UI (`e2e/file-sync-menu.spec.js`)

- [ ] Popup menu opens when clicking footer app icon
- [ ] "Link todo.txt" and "Link done.txt" buttons visible
- [ ] After seeding `fileHandles` store: shows linked file name and "Unlink" button
- [ ] Menu hidden/disabled message when `showOpenFilePicker` not available (test via `page.evaluate` to delete the API)

## Bug-Fixing Strategy

1. Run `pnpm test` after each implementation phase (not just at the end)
2. **Format tests fail:** Fix `todoTxtFormat.js` pure functions first — these have no dependencies
3. **Merge tests fail:** Fix `syncEngine.js` — check `exid` key matching and field priority logic
4. **Menu UI tests fail:** Check DOM structure matches selectors, verify `seedFileHandle` helper writes correct DB version
5. **Existing tests fail (regression):** Most likely cause is the DB version bump (5→6). Fix by updating `seedIndexedDB` in helpers.js to open version 6. Second likely cause: the footer HTML change breaking navigation tests — verify `hash-nav` selectors still match
6. Run full suite after all phases to confirm no regressions

## Git Commit

After all tests pass:

```
git add todoTxtFormat.js fileSync.js syncEngine.js file-sync-menu.js \
       timesheetDb.js app-context.js index.html script.js serviceWorker.js style.css \
       e2e/file-sync-format.spec.js e2e/file-sync-merge.spec.js e2e/file-sync-menu.spec.js \
       e2e/helpers.js
```

```
Implement two-way todo.txt file sync via File System Access API

Adds file picker menu (footer icon popup) to link local todo.txt and
done.txt files. Syncs outbound on every state change, inbound on tab
focus. Uses exid-based merge with file-wins for text, app-wins for
time-tracking fields. IndexedDB stores file handles for persistence.
